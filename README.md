# API-AI


This project was a collaboration with a learner from the AI program, Orhan Nurkan. He created an API to calculate the estimated price of a property with a serie of required and optionnal criteria. 

Our part of the project was to interact with the API (retrieve and push data) and create a user-friendly interface: a form with required and optionnal fields. The data input of the user is sent to the API which will return a response : the price of the chosen type of property.
